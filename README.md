# Distributor Yearly Overview

## Introduction
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow starting from a Data Warehouse and culminating in Power BI visualizations. It focuses on distributor performance for a given year, showcasing sales insights derived from Sell-In and Sell-Through datasets. The project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of distributor contributions to overall performance.

---

## Workflow
1. **Data Extraction**: SQL queries extract relevant Sell-In and Sell-Through data from the Data Warehouse.
2. **Data Transformation**: Data is preprocessed to ensure compatibility with Power BI.
3. **Visualization**: Power BI is used to create dashboards for business insights.
